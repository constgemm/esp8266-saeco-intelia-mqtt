# esp8266-saeco-intelia-mqtt
Control a Philips Saeco Intelia coffee maker with an ESP8266 and MQTT.

## Objective & inspiration

Integrate my Saeco coffee maker into Openhab to control it with MQTT and Google Assistant voice commands.

I wanted to be able to:
* Switch my coffee maker on/off
* See the current status (on / off / ready / warning)
* Trigger espresso button
* Trigger large coffee button
* Trigger tea water button
* Communicate via MQTT for easy integration with Openhab

I was inspired by [OpHaCo's smart coffee maker project](https://github.com/OpHaCo/smart_coffee_machine) and [bntdumas's "Add WiFi to your coffee machine" tutorial](http://www.bntdumas.com/2015/07/15/how-to-add-wifi-to-your-coffee-machine-part-1/) but have a slightly different model and wanted to implement it in Arduino code, not LUA.

## What you need

* Philips Saeco Intelia coffee maker
* ESP8266 (I use model E12 on the Wemos D1 Mini Lite breakout board)
* 2 x 1k resistor to read led color of display backghr
* 1 x 2N2222A transistor *for every button you want to trigger*
* 1 x 1k resistor *for every button you want to trigger*
* a prototype board, basic wire etc.

## What the code does

* Read current machine status (red / yellow / green)
* Press buttons
* Communicate status info to MQTT server
* Listen to MQTT server for commands

## What the code does not do / possible extensions

*WIP*
